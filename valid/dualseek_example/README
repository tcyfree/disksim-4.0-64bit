Design and implementation of DualSeek table

Verion-1: labelled as @4.1, which takes the 4th column in the *.seek as the write-seek-time, It is faster for changing, than version-2 ( @4.2 see below comment)
The constraint is that write-seek-time and read-seek-time must have the same length in array;
One sample dual-seek table is attached.

For backward compatibility, it will automatically detect whether a seek table is Single-seek or Dual-seek, and set a flag (int iFlagDualSeekProfile in mech_g1.h)

Single-seek: *.seek file has 2 or 3 columns
Dual-seek: *.seek has 4 columns.

Definition of dual-seek table:
Column-1: seek-distance in data-cylinder difference
Column-2: read-seek-time in ms
Column-3: StD of seek-time (we see most of the seek table has 2 columns, except Mator-300g)
Column-4: write-seek-time in ms
